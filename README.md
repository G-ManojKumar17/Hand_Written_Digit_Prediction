# Hand_Written_Digit_Prediction
In this project, we divide the number of digits, collect the data from sklearn.datasets, import load_digits, and perform some programming.
<br>
After importing the data, we perform data pre-processing of the image.
<br>
Define the target variables x and y and run the train_test_split command.
<br>
Use RandomForestClassifier to model data as it creates a decision model from different data and uses majority voting for classification and averaging during regression.
<br>
At last, we will use Predictive Models and get the accuracy.
